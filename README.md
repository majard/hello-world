# hello-world
My first repo!

So, I'm supposed to write a little bit about me. My name's Marlon, I study computer science and I love solving problems. I like to read and to watch movies, too. Moreover I'm interested in a wide range of subjects. At this very moment I'm learning how to use github. :)
